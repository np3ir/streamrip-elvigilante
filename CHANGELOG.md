## [2.2.1] — ElVigilante Edition

### Added

- **Configurable `artist_separator`** (`[metadata]` in config.toml)
  — Lets you choose how multiple artists are joined in file names and audio tags
  (`", "`, `" & "`, `" / "`, `"; "`, etc.). Applies to both the embedded
  `ARTIST`/`ALBUMARTIST` tag and the generated file name. Works for Qobuz, Tidal and Deezer.
  Default is `", "` — no behaviour change for existing configs.

- **`AlbumMetadata.from_qobuz` joins all album artists**
  — Previously only `artists[0]` was used. All artists in the Qobuz `artists` array are now
  joined with `artist_separator`, consistent with track-level artist handling.

- **`artist_separator` threaded through `from_album_resp`**
  — `AlbumMetadata.from_album_resp` now accepts and forwards `artist_separator` to
  the source-specific parsers, so albums resolved via `PendingAlbum` also respect the setting.

- **Internal methods have no default for `artist_separator`**
  — `from_qobuz`, `from_tidal`, `from_deezer` and `from_tidal_playlist_track_resp`
  no longer have a hardcoded `= ", "` default. The default lives only on the public
  dispatchers (`from_resp`, `from_track_resp`, `from_album_resp`), preventing silent drift
  between the config value and the hardcoded fallback.

- **`_resolve_track_folder()` accepts `str | os.PathLike[str]`** (`media/playlist.py`)
  — The helper that computes the track folder in a playlist now accepts `pathlib.Path`
  objects in addition to `str`, using `os.fspath()` internally.

- **Improved `rip()` warning** (`media/track.py`)
  — When a track is not downloaded after all retries, the log message now includes the
  track ID (`id=…`) and the configured retry count (`after N retries`) to aid debugging.

- **`max_retries` normalised to `int`** (`config.py`)
  — If `max_retries` comes as a string in the TOML (e.g. `"3"`), it is automatically
  converted to an integer. Negative values are reset to 0 with a warning.

- **`test_semaphore_behavior.py`** — async tests using `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
  — Replaces the previous `asyncio.run()` approach.

- **`source` and `extension` on `_FailingDownloadable`** (`test_track_retry_behavior.py`)
  — Attributes required so `set_failed` never raises `AttributeError` when retries are
  exhausted.

- **Safe post-process guard** (`media/track.py`)
  — If the file does not exist on disk after all retries, `rip()` now logs a descriptive
  warning and returns instead of crashing in `postprocess()`.

- **`_resolve_track_folder()` extracted** (`media/playlist.py`)
  — Folder-resolution logic for playlist tracks moved to a private helper, removing
  duplicated code.

- **Full exponential back-off** (`client/downloadable.py`)
  — Retries wait `retry_delay * 2^attempt` seconds, capped at `max_wait`. DNS failures
  and network errors are retried correctly.

- **Tidal credentials via environment variables**
  — `TIDAL_CLIENT_ID` and `TIDAL_CLIENT_SECRET` can be exported instead of storing
  them in `config.toml`.

- **Test suite** (69 tests across 5 modules)
  — `test_config.py`, `test_db.py`, `test_filepath_utils.py`,
  `test_semaphore_behavior.py`, `test_track_retry_behavior.py`.

- **TiDDL-style colour output**
  — Green for successful downloads, yellow for skipped, red for errors.

- **Full English documentation**
  — README.md, CHANGELOG.md and all files in `docs/` are now in English.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate folder in playlists** with `set_playlist_to_album = true`
  — The album/playlist name is no longer added as a sub-folder when
  `set_playlist_to_album` is enabled (it was being used as both the root folder name
  and a sub-folder, resulting in duplication).

- **`AlbumMetadata` repr in folder names** (`media/playlist.py`)
  — Album folders in playlists were showing the `repr()` of the `AlbumMetadata` object
  instead of the clean album title.

- **Crash in `postprocess()` on download failure**
  — If all retries were exhausted and the file did not exist, the process continued
  into `postprocess()` and crashed. It is now detected and skipped with a warning.

- **`assert` replaced by proper exceptions**
  — Avoids unexpected `AssertionError` in production.

- **Semaphore with conflicting configuration**
  — Setting `concurrency=False` with `max_connections > 1` no longer crashes; it emits
  a descriptive warning instead.

### Changed

- **Flat package layout**
  — Modules live directly under `site-packages/streamrip/` in addition to the standard
  repository layout under `streamrip/streamrip/`.

- **`config.toml` version `2.0.6` baseline**
  — Added `max_retries`, `retry_delay`, `max_wait` under `[downloads]` and
  `artist_separator` under `[metadata]`.

## [2.0.6] — nathom/streamrip (upstream base)

Base from which this fork was created. See the
[upstream project history](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/releases)
for prior changes.

> This fork maintains full compatibility with the upstream `config.toml` format.
> All new settings have defaults that preserve the original behaviour.
